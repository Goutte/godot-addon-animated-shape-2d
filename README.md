A [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) `4.x` addon that adds an `AnimatedShape2D` that can provide a custom shape for each frame of each animation of an `AnimatedSprite2D`.

It is useful to make custom hitboxes, hurtboxes, and hardboxes for each pose of your character, if you animated it using `AnimatedSprite2D`.

It comes with an Editor GUI to preview and edit your shapes, in the fashion of the `SpriteFrames` bottom panel.
